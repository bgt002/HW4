                    Quick Introduction about Brian:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hello! Nice to meet everyone. I was born and raised in Santa Ana, California 
                    and I am currently a 4th year <em>Electrical and Computer Engineering</em> major at UCSD.
                    I hope to find a career in Software Engineering when I graduate. I enjoy watching
                    basketball, and my favorite team are the Los Angeles Lakers. I also follow tennis,
                    and my favorite tennis player is Roger Federer (even though he is retired.) I also
                    enjoy using photoshop to make funny images/gifs like below:
